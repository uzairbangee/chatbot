# Weather Messenger Chatbot

This is basically a chatbot which will tell you about the current weather situation of a particular city around the world. You only have to type the city name through your messenger to the page where the bot is deployed and it will tell you the weather conditions of that city.

So just get the code and deploy it where ever you want.

I have used Facebook Developer Messenger API and Google Action API to create it.

Create a .env file and add access token and other credentials over there.
